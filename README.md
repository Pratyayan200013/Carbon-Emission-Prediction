Experimenting with two differnt regression models, we try to arrive at the most accurate prediction of the CO2 emission of a new car model. Following are the regression models we experiment with:-

• In the regression model for each of the dependent variables, 4 independent variables are being considered which are Country, Year, Population and GDP. 

• There was a lot of nuance in the dataset, so the most importangt step was Data Preprocessing.

• Proper handling of the missing values and categorical data has been done.

• Data Visualization has been done to understand the carbon emission trends from 1850 to 2021 for India, China and the Asian continent as a whole.

• After Predicting the results using Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression Models Graphs have been plotted for Actual vs Predicted data, where we discovered that the variation between the predicted and the actual data is much less in the Decision tree regression Model. 

• Mean Squared Error is being used as a prediction metrics and the mean squared error for the DTR model is much less than that of the LR model.

• From the results we concluded that the Decision Tree Regression Model is a better model than the linear Regression Model for predicting Carbon emissions.
